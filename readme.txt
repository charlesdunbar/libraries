Libraries used for Arduino projects

Found an ht1632c library at https://github.com/cbonsig/openclock/tree/master/openclock/libraries/ht1632c, didn't compile, and didn't have a feature I wanted (centering text).  Just throw this in your Arduino projects folder and you should have access to the libraries.
